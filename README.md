Just trying to play around with AndroidStudio

Debugging on Device
-------------------
The following information helped a ton
 - [Using Hardware Devices](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html)
 - [OEM Drivers](http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html)
 - I needed to update from [Motorola](https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/answers/prod_detail/a_id/90853/p/30,6720,8448)

One thing that wasn't mentioned was in Settings -> Developer I needed to Check the "USB Debugging" option
